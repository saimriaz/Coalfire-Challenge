# Coalfire-Challenge
Challenge for coalfire.

These files should be the foundation to the IaC part of question 3 of Scenario 1. 
I have created two templates of my own; the project template as well as the VM compute engine instance. 
Please feel free to contact me via email at riazsaim@gmail.com. I am also available to explain my code in a call. 
I have a lot more templates to create and provision such as GCS buckets, SSL certificates, IP reservations, secret managers etc.
Very happy to showcase more, and thank you again for your time!
